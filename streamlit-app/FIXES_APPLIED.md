# Fixes Applied to Streamlit App

## Summary
This document tracks all the fixes applied to resolve issues in the Streamlit app.

## Issues Fixed (December 19, 2024)

### 1. CSS Syntax Error in `config/styling.py`
**Issue**: Invalid CSS syntax in `.quote-box::before` selector
```css
content: """; /* Invalid - triple quotes */
```
**Fix**: Changed to valid CSS syntax
```css
content: '"'; /* Valid - single double quote */
```

### 2. Missing Functions in `logic/matching.py`
**Issue**: `get_personalized_recommendations` function was missing
**Fix**: Added the function implementation

### 3. Missing Functions in `core/session.py`
**Issue**: Several functions referenced in other modules were missing
**Fix**: Added missing functions:
- `track_assessment_progress()`
- `save_assessment_state()`
- `load_assessment_state()`
- `detect_assessment_inconsistencies()`
- `track_action_pattern()`
- `check_action_fatigue()`
- `record_user_feedback()`
- `get_accessibility_preferences()`

### 4. Missing Functions in `logic/tracking.py`
**Issue**: Functions referenced in other modules were missing
**Fix**: Added missing functions:
- `get_user_streak()`
- `get_recent_actions()`

### 5. Missing Functions in `logic/encouragement.py`
**Issue**: Functions referenced in other modules were missing
**Fix**: Added missing functions:
- `get_streak_celebration()`
- `get_multi_action_celebration()`

### 6. Progress Bar Value Error in `pages/assessment.py`
**Issue**: Progress bar receiving negative value (-0.25) when assessment_step is 0
```python
progress = (st.session_state.assessment_step - 1) / 4  # Results in -0.25 when step=0
```
**Fix**: Added bounds checking and fixed initialization
```python
progress = max(0, (st.session_state.assessment_step - 1) / 4)  # Ensures non-negative values
```
Also changed initial assessment_step from 0 to 1 in session initialization.

## Testing Results
- ✅ All modules now import successfully
- ✅ CSS styling loads without syntax errors  
- ✅ Main app runs without runtime errors
- ✅ Progress bar displays correctly
- ✅ All page modules load successfully
- ✅ Assessment flow works without crashes

## App Status
The Streamlit app is now fully functional and ready for use. All major syntax errors, missing function definitions, and runtime issues have been resolved.

The app can be started with:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

All warnings about "missing ScriptRunContext" when running with `python app.py` are normal and can be ignored - they don't affect functionality when running properly with `streamlit run`.
