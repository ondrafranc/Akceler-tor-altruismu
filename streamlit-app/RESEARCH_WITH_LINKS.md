## **MANDATORY RESEARCH COMPLETED** ✅

This file documents the required research phase for:
- “Make the whole app feel like the landing page”
- “Add a beautiful map with real nearby opportunities/organizations”
- “Rewrite Values Discovery + Action Selection in Journey”

---

## Local Codebase Analysis

### What we found
- **Landing page already uses SvelteKit + Tailwind** (`akcelerator-landing-page/package.json`) but has **no real map library** dependency yet.
- The “map” on the landing page is currently a **custom illustrated CZ regions component**, not a geospatial map: `akcelerator-landing-page/src/components/CzechMap.svelte`.
- Streamlit Journey steps still had **legacy gradient-heavy UI** in:
  - `streamlit-app/core/journey.py` (`_show_values_discovery_step`, `_show_action_selection_step`, `_render_action_card`)
- Quick Help had only a **basic location dropdown** (Praha/Brno/Ostrava) and the underlying data uses `requirements.location` (not consistently `action.location`).

### How that informed implementation
- We leaned on a **calm global CSS design system** (`streamlit-app/config/styling.py`) and removed local gradients in Journey steps.
- For “near you + map”, we implemented:
  - **Interactive map view** via `folium + streamlit-folium`
  - **Real nearby place data** via OpenStreetMap/Overpass (best-effort, cached)

## Internet Research (2025)

🔗 **[Streamlit Theming Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/theming)**
- **Found via web search:** Official Streamlit theming guide.
- **Key Insights:** Prefer theme-first customization; keep CSS overrides minimal and resilient.
- **Applicable:** Use a calm design system and avoid brittle CSS selectors.

🔗 **[Streamlit “Designing for the user” (Part II)](https://blog.streamlit.io/designing-streamlit-apps-for-the-user-part-ii/?utm_source=openai)**
- **Found via web search:** Streamlit UX guidance.
- **Key Insights:** Reduce cognitive load, create clear hierarchy, one primary CTA.
- **Applicable:** Values → Action flow uses fewer simultaneous CTAs and calmer cards.

🔗 **[Microsoft Streamlit UI Template](https://github.com/microsoft/Streamlit_UI_Template)**
- **Found via web search:** Reference template for polished Streamlit UIs.
- **Key Insights:** Centralize styling and keep UI consistent.
- **Applicable:** Reinforced “design system” approach.

🔗 **[streamlit-geolocation (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-geolocation/?utm_source=openai)**
- **Found via web search:** Streamlit component for browser geolocation.
- **Key Insights:** Can obtain user lat/lon via the browser.
- **Applicable:** Used as optional enhancement; app still works without it.

🔗 **[streamlit-folium (GitHub)](https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium?utm_source=openai)**
- **Found via web search:** Standard approach to embed interactive maps in Streamlit.
- **Key Insights:** Supports click events (`last_clicked`) and full interactive maps.
- **Applicable:** Used for a “beautiful map” inside Streamlit with click-to-set-location.

🔗 **[Create a multipage app (Streamlit docs)](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/tutorials/create-a-multipage-app)**
- **Found via web search:** Official tutorial.
- **Key Insights:** Organize experiences into clear pages to reduce overwhelm.
- **Applicable:** Informed the “Map vs List” tab split in Quick Help.

## Synthesis & Recommendation

- **If you want the landing page feel everywhere**, Streamlit can be improved (we did), but **a full UI match** is best achieved by migrating the “app” into the existing **SvelteKit** project.
- **For real local data**, OpenStreetMap-derived places are a practical first step. If you want true “opportunities” (events/volunteer slots), we’ll likely need:
  - A dedicated dataset + moderation, or
  - A partner/API (often requires keys, ToS, and ongoing maintenance)
